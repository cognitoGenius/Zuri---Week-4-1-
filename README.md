# Description

This is a submission for the week 4 task of the second cohort of the 14G Zuri training.
It is a simple guessing game where the user is asked to enter his username and then make a guess between a range of numbers that constantly increases with each correct guess.
Initially, the user is given 3 tries, this means that you can make 3 incorrect guesses before the game is over. 
Note, if a guess is incorrect, your level nor score does not increase nor go down. Happy Playing!!!
